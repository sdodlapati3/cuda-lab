# Tutorials (DEPRECATED)

> ⚠️ **This directory is deprecated.** All tutorial content has been integrated into the [learning-path/](../learning-path/) notebooks.

## Migration Notes

- The single existing tutorial (`01-cpu-vs-gpu.md`) has been moved to `notes/reference/`
- All planned tutorial content is now covered by interactive notebooks in `learning-path/`
- See [LEARNING-TRACKS.md](../LEARNING-TRACKS.md) for the recommended learning paths

## Why Deprecated?

1. **Duplication**: The `learning-path/` notebooks cover the same material with interactive code
2. **Incomplete**: Only 1 of 40+ planned tutorials was created
3. **Better format**: Jupyter notebooks provide hands-on learning that markdown tutorials cannot

## Recommended Alternative

Use the [Learning Path](../learning-path/README.md) instead:
- 18 weeks of interactive Jupyter notebooks
- Executable CUDA C++ code examples
- Checkpoint quizzes for self-assessment
- Colab-compatible for easy access
