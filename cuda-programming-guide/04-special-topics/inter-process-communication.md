Communication between multiple GPUs managed by different host processes is supported through the use of interprocess communication (IPC) APIs and IPC-shareable memory buffers, by creating process-portable handles that are subsequently used to obtain process-local device pointers to the device memory on peer GPUs.

Any device memory pointer or event handle created by a host thread can be directly referenced by any other thread within the same process. However, device pointers or event handles are not valid outside the process that created them, and therefore cannot be directly referenced by threads belonging to a different process. To access device memory and CUDA events across processes, an application must use CUDA Interprocess Communication (IPC) or Virtual Memory Management APIs to create process-portable handles that can be shared with other processes using standard host operating system IPC mechanisms, e.g., interprocess shared memory or files. Once the process-portable handles have been exchanged between processes, process-local device pointers must be obtained from the handles using CUDA IPC or VMM APIs. Process-local device pointers can then be used just as they would within a single process.

The same kind of portable-handle approach used for IPC within a single-node and single operating system instance is also used for peer-to-peer communication among the GPUs in multi-node NVLink-connected clusters. In the multi-node case, communicating GPUs are managed by processes running within independent operating system instances on each cluster node, requiring additional abstraction above the level of operating system instances. Multi-node peer communication is achieved by creating and exchanging so-called “fabric” handles between multi-node GPU peers, and by then obtaining process-local device pointers within the participating processes and operating system instances corresponding to the multi-node ranks.

See below (single-node CUDA IPC) and ref::virtual-memory-management for the specific APIs used to establish and exchange process-portable and node and operating system instance-portable handles that are used to obtain process-local device pointers for GPU communication.

Note

There are individual advantages and limitations associated with the use of the CUDA IPC APIs and Virtual Memory Management (VMM) APIs when used for IPC.

The CUDA IPC API is only currently supported on Linux platforms.

The CUDA Virtual Memory Management APIs permit per-allocation control over peer accessibility and sharing at memory allocation time, but require the use of the CUDA Driver API.

4.15.1. IPC using the Legacy Interprocess Communication API[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/inter-process-communication.html.md#ipc-using-the-legacy-interprocess-communication-api "Link to this heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To share device memory pointers and events across processes, an application must use the CUDA Interprocess Communication API, which is described in detail in the reference manual. The IPC API permits an application to get the IPC handle for a given device memory pointer using `cudaIpcGetMemHandle()`. A CUDA IPC handle can be passed to another process using standard host operating system IPC mechanisms, e.g., interprocess shared memory or files. `cudaIpcOpenMemHandle()` uses the IPC handle to retrieve a valid device pointer that can be used within the other process. Event handles can be shared using similar entry points.

An example of using the IPC API is where a single primary process generates a batch of input data, making the data available to multiple secondary processes without requiring regeneration or copying.

Note

The IPC API is only supported on Linux.

Note that the IPC API is not supported for `cudaMallocManaged` allocations.

Applications using CUDA IPC to communicate with each other should be compiled, linked, and run with the same CUDA driver and runtime.

Allocations made by `cudaMalloc()` may be sub-allocated from a larger block of memory for performance reasons. In such case, CUDA IPC APIs will share the entire underlying memory block which may cause other sub-allocations to be shared, which can potentially lead to information disclosure between processes. To prevent this behavior, it is recommended to only share allocations with a 2MiB aligned size.

Only the IPC events-sharing APIs are supported on L4T and embedded Linux Tegra devices with compute capability 7.x and higher. The IPC memory-sharing APIs are not supported on Tegra platforms.

4.15.2. IPC using the Virtual Memory Management API[#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/inter-process-communication.html.md#ipc-using-the-virtual-memory-management-api "Link to this heading")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CUDA Virtual Memory Management API allows the creation of IPC-shareable memory allocations, and it supports multiple operating systems by virtue of operating-system specific IPC handle data structures.
