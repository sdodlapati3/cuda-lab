# Week 29: Quantization Fundamentals

Understanding and implementing quantized inference for ML models.

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Topic | Focus |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 1 | Quantization Basics | INT8 representation, scaling |
| 2 | Symmetric Quantization | Zero-centered quantization |
| 3 | Asymmetric Quantization | Full range utilization |
| 4 | Calibration | Finding optimal scale factors |
| 5 | Quantized GEMM | INT8 matrix multiplication |
| 6 | Summary | Week review and benchmarks |

## Key Concepts
- Quantization: Mapping FP32 → INT8
- Scale factor: FP32 = INT8 × scale
- Zero point: For asymmetric quantization
- Calibration: Statistical analysis for optimal parameters
