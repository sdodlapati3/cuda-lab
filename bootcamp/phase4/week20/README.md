# Week 20: Integration & Capstone

## Overview
This final week of Phase 4 focuses on integrating CUDA code with higher-level languages and completing a capstone project that demonstrates mastery of GPU programming concepts.

## Daily Topics

| Day | Topic | Key Concepts |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Python Bindings | pybind11, ctypes, NumPy interop |
| 2 | Multi-GPU Basics | Device selection, peer access, data parallelism |
| 3 | Profiling Workflow | nsys, ncu, optimization cycle |
| 4 | Capstone Planning | Project selection, design, milestones |
| 5 | Capstone Implementation | Building the project |
| 6 | Capstone Review | Documentation, presentation, review |

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Create Python bindings for CUDA kernels
- Distribute work across multiple GPUs
- Profile and optimize complete GPU applications
- Design and implement a substantial CUDA project

## Capstone Project Ideas

### 1. Real-Time Particle Simulator
Combine N-body, spatial hashing, and collision detection from Week 19

### 2. GPU Image Processing Pipeline
Chain multiple image operations with efficient memory management

### 3. ML Inference Engine
Build on Week 18's work for a complete inference solution

### 4. Physics-Based Renderer
Simple ray marching or path tracing implementation

### 5. Custom Application
Propose your own project applying learned techniques

## Success Criteria
- Working code with proper error handling
- Performance benchmarks with analysis
- Documentation of design decisions
- Comparison with CPU baseline (if applicable)
